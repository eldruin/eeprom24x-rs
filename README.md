This is a platform agnostic Rust driver for the 24x series serial EEPROM,
based on the [`embedded-hal`] traits.

[`embedded-hal`]: https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal

This driver allows you to:
- Read a single byte from a memory address. See: `read_byte()`.
- Read a byte array starting on a memory address. See: `read_data()`.
- Read the current memory address (please read notes). See: `read_current_address()`.
- Write a byte to a memory address. See: `write_byte()`.
- Write a byte array (up to a memory page) to a memory address. See: `write_page()`.
- Read `CSx`-variant devices' factory-programmed unique serial. See: `read_unique_serial()`.
- Use the device in generic code via the `Eeprom24xTrait`.

Can be used at least with the devices listed below.

[Introductory blog post](https://blog.eldruin.com/24x-serial-eeprom-driver-in-rust/)

## The devices
These devices provides a number of bits of serial electrically erasable and
programmable read only memory (EEPROM) organized as a number of words of 8 bits
each. The devices' cascadable feature allows up to 8 devices to share a common
2-wire bus. The devices are optimized for use in many industrial and commercial
applications where low power and low voltage operation are essential.

## Usage

To use this driver, import this crate and an `embedded_hal` implementation,
then instantiate the appropriate device.
In the following examples an instance of the device AT24C256 will be created
as an example. Other devices can be created with similar methods like:
`Eeprom24x::new_24x64(...)`.

Please find additional examples using hardware in this repository: [driver-examples]

[driver-examples]: https://github.com/eldruin/driver-examples

```rust
use eeprom24x::{Eeprom24x, SlaveAddr};
use embedded_hal::blocking::delay::DelayMs;
use linux_embedded_hal::{Delay, I2cdev};

fn main() {
    let dev = I2cdev::new("/dev/i2c-1").unwrap();
    let address = SlaveAddr::default();
    let mut eeprom = Eeprom24x::new_24x256(dev, address);
    let memory_address = 0x1234;
    let data = 0xAB;

    eeprom.write_byte(memory_address, data).unwrap();

    Delay.delay_ms(5u16);

    let read_data = eeprom.read_byte(memory_address).unwrap();

    println!(
        "Read memory address: {}, retrieved content: {}",
        memory_address, &read_data
    );

    let _dev = eeprom.destroy(); // Get the I2C device back
}
```
